        Hello! My name is Zuzeth pronouned "Zoo-Zeth", just like my name I like to provide a unique perspective into everything I go into. I love learning and improving on myself, my career aspirations, and my education.
        My motto for learning is to learn constantly and daily. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy reading non-fiction, money management, inspirational, and motivational books. My current read right now is Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins.
        I also like to stay active mostly through hiking and working out in my living room. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm taking the U of U Coding Bootcamp in hopes that I can start a new career path. My goal is to enjoy what I do for a living.
