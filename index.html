        Hello! My name is Zuzeth pronouned "Zoo-Zeth", just like my name I like to provide a unique perspective into everything I do. I love learning and improving on myself, my career aspirations, and my education.
        My motto for learning is to learn constantly and daily. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently attending the University of Utah Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. I began this program in April 2019 and am set to graduate by October 2019. I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and still continue to learn 
        new functions and programs everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this program I have discovered a passion of mine, UI/UX Design, it is something I wish to pursue professionally and am excited for an opportunity to enter this new career.
